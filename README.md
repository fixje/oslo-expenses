=============

Pulls data from Google Spreadsheets and draws some charts. I use it to keep track of my expenses abroad.
To use it for yourself the following column layout is necessary:
| Date | Description | Foreign Currency | Your Currency | Category |

* Date must be the format as used in Germany: "dd.mm.YY". If you don't like it, change it in the code, shouldn't be difficult.
* Categories can be looked up in the code.

There is support for the following languages:
* English
* German
